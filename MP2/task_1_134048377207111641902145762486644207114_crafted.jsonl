So, the function will return a tuple with the count of even and odd palindromes in the range from 1 to 123.\n\nThe function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` takes an integer n as input and returns a tuple. The tuple contains the count of even and odd palindromes in the range from 1 to n.\n\nThe helper function `is_palindrome(n)` checks if a number is a palindrome. It converts the number to a string and compares it with its reverse. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome.\n\nThe function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` initializes two counters, `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, to 0. It then iterates over the range from 1 to n. If the number is odd and a palindrome, it increments `odd_palindrome_count`. If the number is even and a palindrome, it increments `even_palindrome_count`. Finally, it returns a tuple with `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`.\n\nSo, if the input is '123', the function will return a tuple with the count of even and odd palindromes in the range from 1 to 123.\n", "is_correct": "False"}

The function returns the string with the words sorted in ascending order based on their numerical value.\n\nIf the input is '', the function will return ''.\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The function receives an empty string as input.\n2. The function splits the input string into a list of words using the `split(' ')` method. This method splits the string at each space character and returns a list of the substrings.\n3. The function filters out any empty strings from the list using a list comprehension with an `if x` condition.\n4. The function sorts the list of words using the `sorted()` function. The `sorted()` function takes a list and returns a new list with the elements sorted. The `key` argument of the `sorted()` function is a function that takes an element of the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the `key` function is a lambda function that takes a word and returns the numerical value of the word from the `value_map` dictionary.\n5. The function joins the sorted list of words back into a string using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is the concatenation of the strings in the list, with the strings separated by the string that the `join()` method is called on.\n6. The function returns the sorted string of words.\n\nSo, if the input is '', the function will return ''.\n\n[Output]\n''\n[/Output]\n", "is_correct": "True"}
